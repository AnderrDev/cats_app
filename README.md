# cats_app

"The Cat App" is a mobile application developed in Flutter that connects to TheCatApi to load and display a list of cat-related data. The app utilizes the GetX package as the state management solution, providing an efficient and straightforward approach to handling application logic.

Key Features:

Data Listing: The app presents a list of cat data obtained from TheCatApi. The list is updated in real-time thanks to GetX's capability to handle reactivity in the user interface.

Cat Search: Users can search for specific cats using the integrated search feature in the application. GetX simplifies the implementation of real-time search and automatically updates the results list.

Cat Details: By tapping on a cat from the list, users can access a details screen that displays more in-depth information about the selected cat, such as its breed, characteristics, and photos.

HTTP Requests: The application utilizes HTTP requests to communicate with TheCatApi and fetch cat data. The GetX package for handling requests streamlines server communication and efficiently manages errors.

SOLID Structure: The code follows SOLID principles, promoting a clean and maintainable design, facilitating future updates and enhancements to the application.

In summary, "The Cat App" is a mobile application developed in Flutter that harnesses the power of GetX to provide a smooth and reactive user experience when loading, searching, and viewing cat data from TheCatApi. With a solid structure and efficient state management and HTTP request handling, this app serves as an excellent starting point for any cat lover looking to enjoy a fun and engaging experience.
